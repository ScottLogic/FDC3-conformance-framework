# FDC3 Conformance Framework

A framework for testing whether desktop containers implement the [FDC3 standard](https://fdc3.finos.org/).

This project currently targets FDC3 v1.2.

## Installation

This repository currently contains:

 - `tests` - the FDC3 conformance tests, implemented using Mocha / TypeScript, making use of the FDC3 type definitions, [@finos/fdc3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finos/fdc3).
 - `app` - A React application that hosts the tests, allowing them to be executed from within a desktop container.
 - `cli` - Documentation and an example that demosntrates how these tests can be run within a CI environment.

In order to get started, install all the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn
```

Then build all the components with:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Run tests in React framework

Navigate to `/app`, then run:

```sh
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

The framework will be available on `http://localhost:3000`
