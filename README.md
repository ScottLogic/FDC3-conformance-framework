# FDC3 Conformance Framework

A framework for testing whether desktop containers implement the [FDC3 standard](https://fdc3.finos.org/).

This project currently targets FDC3 v1.2.

## Installation

This repository currently contains:

 - `tests` - the FDC3 conformance tests, implemented using Mocha / TypeScript, making use of the FDC3 type definitions, [@finos/fdc3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finos/fdc3).
 - `app` - A simple application that hosts the tests, allowing them to be executed from within a desktop container.
 - `mock` - Multiple mock applications that are used to verify conformance - [details](./mock/README.md)

In order to get started, install all the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn
```

Then build all the components with:

```sh
yarn build
```

The server(s) can be started as follows:

```sh
// Start the app which runs the tests
cd app
yarn start

// Start all the mock apps which the tests will make use of
cd mock
yarn start
```

The application will start and will open a webbrowser tab, this tab will have an error. The reason is that the app does not have a Window.FDC3 object and should be ran through the desktop agent.

Here is the setup steps for the following desktop agents:
